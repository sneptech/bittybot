<current_state>
Phase 3 code execution is COMPLETE (all 5 plans, all auto tasks). Plan 03-05 Task 3 is a human visual verification checkpoint — the app needs to be run on a device/emulator and visually inspected. The checkpoint was NOT cleared; no continuation agent was spawned.

All 19 unit tests pass. Debug APK builds. No code work remains — only verification and merge.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 03-01: Flutter project bootstrap, deps, Lato fonts, Drift DB stub (3 tasks, 4 commits)
- Plan 03-02: Dark theme system — WCAG palette, Lato TextTheme, manual ColorScheme (2 tasks, 3 commits)
- Plan 03-03: Localization — 10-language ARB files, AppLocalizations codegen (2 tasks, 3 commits)
- Plan 03-04: Settings persistence — Riverpod AsyncNotifier, error message resolver (2 tasks, 3 commits)
- Plan 03-05: App shell wiring — main.dart, BittyBotApp, startup gate, loading/error screens, unit tests (2/3 tasks, 2 commits — Task 3 is visual checkpoint)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 03-05 Task 3: Visual verification on device/emulator (checkpoint)
  - Run `flutter run` and check: dark green theme, lime progress indicator, Lato font, 16sp body text
  - Locale switching: Arabic (RTL), Japanese, unsupported → English fallback
  - `flutter test` regression check
- Verification chain (scope-check, change-summary, verify-work, update-claude-md)
- Merge this worktree branch into main
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- flutter_riverpod pinned to 3.1.0 (not 3.2.1) — SDK version conflict
- synthetic-package removed from l10n.yaml — deprecated in Flutter 3.38.5
- Manual ColorScheme() constructor, not fromSeed — preserves exact brand hex values
- AsyncValue.value not .valueOrNull — Riverpod 3.1.0 API
- EdgeInsetsDirectional throughout (not EdgeInsets) — RTL-ready pattern
- Flutter path: /home/max/Android/flutter/bin/flutter (not on PATH)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — all code compiles, all tests pass. Only human verification checkpoint remains.

<context>
This is one of THREE parallel phase worktrees. All three phases reached checkpoints simultaneously:
- Phase 1 (master, ~/git/bittybot): Hardware verification checkpoint — needs Android device testing
- Phase 2 (phase/02-model-distribution, ~/git/bittybot-phase-02): Visual verification checkpoint
- Phase 3 (phase/03-app-foundation, ~/git/bittybot-phase-03): Visual verification checkpoint (THIS)

See .planning/PARALLEL-RESUME.md for the multi-worktree orchestration plan.

<next_action>
1. Run verification chain (scope-check → change-summary → verify-work → update-claude-md) per RECOMMENDED-WORKFLOW-CHAIN.md
2. Run `flutter run` on device/emulator for visual checkpoint
3. Merge worktrees back to main
